    "text": "This note aims at setting out guidelines for population inference using weights and design variables with UK Data Service social surveys. It focuses on providing users with practical procedures for reliable estimation and only discuss the theoretical underpinnings of the survey design with respect to the sampling or estimation using weighted survey data. The content is based on technical documents by data producers such as the Office for National Statistics as well as the relevant statistical literature. Examples are currently drawn from the UK Labour Force Survey, the Family Expenditure Survey and the British Social Attitudes survey and will gradually be expanded. A list of key references and online tutorials is provided in the bibliography.\nSocial surveys are data collection exercises that produce datasets enabling researchers and analysts to learn about the characteristics of human populations and societies. This is achieved by way of conducting statistical inference, the process through which unknown quantities (sometimes called parameters) of such ‘large’ populations are estimated with the help of samples that are drawn from them. Estimation of population parameters traditionally consists of computing two pieces of information: a measure of a value of interest also known as the point estimate, such as a mean or a median, together with an indication of its degree of uncertainty or precision (their standard error). Alternatively, one may also want to represent population estimates directly as a range or interval of likely values.\nIt has been demonstrated that when certain conditions are met, such as when samples are randomly drawn and the sample size is large enough, surveys and the parameter estimates inferred from them are representative of the corresponding target population (Lohr 2019 - 2010). Robust, unbiased estimates are estimates that are not only representative – they reflect the characteristic of interest in the population, but also precise enough for the inference to be meaningful. Unfortunately, in part as a result of design decisions, in part – and increasingly so – due to non response, estimates of population parameters from real-world social surveys based on the raw and unadjusted data present some degree of bias.\nIt is usually considered that in order to produce robust population estimates from samples, including as much of the survey design information as possible alongside the survey weights is required as these are typically calculated to compensate for the survey design and non-response and coverage errors. Conversely, estimates computed without survey weights or accounting for the survey design will at best present some degree of bias or might even be altogether unreliable. Computing weighted estimates and accounting for survey design requires specific procedures that are not usually very well documented as the relevant statistical techniques are more complex. They are therefore often overlooked in introductory textbooks, and their practical implementation in statistical software not always clear. It is therefore necessary to add some clarity to this situation and provide adequate guidelines in order for users of UKDS data to properly implement robust estimation strategies that are adapted to their needs. This document sets out these guidelines."

    "section": "1.1 Clustering",
    "text": "1.1 Clustering\nClustering usually goes hand in hand with multistage sampling, that is drawing sample units in several stages rather than all at once. It consists of dividing the population into groups that are as internally heterogeneous as possible - one could think of them as ‘mini populations’, some of which are then randomly selected while others are left out.\nThe UK context\nIn Great-Britain, the closest to a population register that can be used as a sampling frame is a list of addresses kept by Royal Mail, also know as the Postcode Address File (PAF). For Northern Ireland the most commonly used is the Land and Property Services Agency’s (LPSA). As a list of addresses, the PAF cannot be used to draw a simple random sample of either households or individuals as the number of dwellings, households and individuals at each address in not indicated.\nThe nature of the PAF address structure easily enables geographical clustering in UK surveys. Addresses, or ’delivery points’ cluster into larger units, for example the post code M13 9PL is embedded within the the M13 ‘post code district’ and the M13 9 ‘postcode sector’. Survey designs often use either postcode sectors or districts as Primary Sampling Units (PSUs) to reduce fieldwork costs and time.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Clustering in two stage sampling\n\n\nFigure 1 provides a simplified illustration of clustering with four districts. The higher level clusters, i.e. those at which the first random draw happened, are denoted the Primary Sampling Units (PSUs). The dotted lines indicate that districts 1 and 4 have been selected to be in the sample. A second stage of sampling follows, where addresses are sampled from within the two sampled districts and each address may contain one or more households. As a result, of this design we obtain a sample of addresses but these addresses are clustered within a sample of districts. Subsequent drawing of either further clusters, for example, households or drawing final individual sample members, takes place within the already selected PSUs. In large scale surveys the PSUs are often geographical areas.\nHousehold level clustering\nA lesser discussed aspect of clustering arises if all individuals at a sampled household are selected. This is the case for our large-scale household surveys in the UK such as the Labour Force Survey. Imagine we are estimating the proportion of individuals who are born outside the UK from a population of 100 people who live in 50 households. We would expect people who are born outside the UK to be more likely to live together than if they were scattered randomly across all households. Instead, we will find them ‘clustered’ within households, with some households being wholly overseas born, some mixed and most wholly UK born.\ne.g. \nHousehold 1: 1 UK born individuals \nHousehold 2: 3 UK born \nHousehold 3: 2 Overseas born \nHousehold 4: 6 UK born \nHousehold 5: 1 Overseas born, 1 UK born \nHousehold 6: 2 UK born \nHousehold 7: 1 UK born \nHousehold 8: 1 UK born \nHousehold 9: 5 Overseas born \nHousehold 10: 3 UK born \nAnd so on…\nAnd so on… This clustering within households means that if we are selecting only one in ten of the households for our sample we might expect the sample to be less accurate in predicting the proportion of our population who were born outside the UK than if we had sampled individuals at random.\nMore generally, using clustering comes at the cost of making the sampling coarser in the sense that we are shrinking the size of the population from which it is going to be drawn - reducing its diversity - which in turn makes the estimates produced from the resulting data less precise. We will come back to this in the next section."

    "text": "1.2 Stratification\nIn stratified sampling, the population is divided into groups, or strata, and a sample of units is selected from each strata. Stratified sampling ensures that the sample includes a certain proportion of units from the selected groups that may have been missed otherwise. By contrast with clustering, strata are constructed so as to maximise their internal homogeneity.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: An example of stratified sampling\n\n\nFigure 2 provides a simplified example where the population is divided into four strata: North, South, East and West. Within each strata five sampling units (represented by addresses) are selected.\nCommon stratification characteristics used in UK surveys are geographical (e.g. Government Office Regions); socio-economic (e.g. proportion of people in the area in certain occupations; car ownership) or demographic (e.g. proportion of people who are pensioners, population density). Such information is usually obtained from Census data.\nIt is considered that overall stratification increases the precision of survey estimates, by improving the representativeness of potentially less represented or harder to reach groups."

    "text": "1.3 Proportionate vs non proportionate stratification\nIn simple random sampling, each element drawn from the sampling frame has an equal selection probability, therefore the sampling fraction is \\(n/N\\), with \\(n\\) the sample size and N the population size. This can either be achieved by directly selecting sample units at random or by choosing a random start and sampling at pre-specified intervals – also known as systematic sampling.\nIn the context of stratified sampling, proportionate stratification refers to cases where the same sampling fraction is used for elements within all stratum: i.e. \\(n_h/N_h\\) where h represents the strata \\(n_h\\) the sample size in strata \\(h\\) and \\(N_h\\) the population in strata \\(h\\). We can see this in Figure 2 as the same proportion of units is selected for all strata with a sampling fraction of \\(1/4\\).\nIt is sometimes necessary to use disproportionate stratification where the sampling fraction varies across strata. This method is used to increase the numbers of a specific group in the population and is useful when a sub-population of interest is numerically small, like less populated areas or ethnic minority groups. In such a case, \\(n_h/N_h&gt;n_{h+1}/N_{h+1}\\): the sampling fraction in stratum \\(h\\) is larger i.e. we are proportionally drawing more units in that stratum relative to its size, than in stratum \\(h+1\\).\nFor example, for the British Election Study 2010, respondents from an ethnic minority background were over-sampled as too little was known about ethnic minority voting behaviour. Disproportionate stratification will mean some groups are over-represented in the sample and therefore adjustments are needed before we can analyse the data and this is through the survey weights. Survey weights are also needed to compensate for non-response or when sample frames do not cover exactly the target population of inference. Survey weights are described in the next section."

    "section": "2.1 Survey design variables",
    "text": "2.1 Survey design variables\nSurvey Weights are a special type of numeric variable included in survey datasets, whose value reflects the relative ‘importance’ of observations in the sample. They are usually higher for observations from persons less likely to be part of the sample (for example for young men in urban areas), lower for those more likely to be part of the sample (for example women over 50). They are designed to prevent estimates from being biased, that is reflecting a value that is not representative of the population. They are usually made of at least three components:\n\na design component that accounts for issues of unequal probability of selection of sample members resulting from survey design;\na non-response component, correcting for (known) lower propensity to take part to surveys among certain categories of respondents.\nA calibrating or benchmarking component that ensures that weighted demographic variables, such as age, sex and geography, match the current ONS population estimates.\n\nThese components are sometimes individually called ‘weights’ in their own right, but in practice they are usually merged into a single variable. Survey weights may also be rescaled in order to inflate sample counts to population totals thus becoming grossing weights which enables estimation of population size. In that sense, the numerical values of the weights attached to observations are an indication of the number of units these observations ‘represent’ in the population.\nThe computation of weights by survey designers rely on calibration algorithms that optimise the conditional distribution of sample observations across categories of the weighting variables (for example people of a certain age range, gender and economic status) with a view to strike a balance between minimising the standard errors (which depends on the number of observation in each such ‘cell’) and maximising representativeness (making sure that all cells have observations).\nSurvey design variables typically consist of identifiers for the strata and/or clusters used during the sampling process, especially the Primary Sampling Units (PSU), that is clusters that were drawn during the first stage of sampling. Used in conjunction with weights, they enable researchers to produce more accurate estimates (with the help of dedicated survey estimation functions in statistical packages) than would be the case if solely survey weights had been used. However, whereas most surveys curated by the UK Data Service include survey weights, survey design variables are not always provided by data producers due to data protection concerns."

They can therefore be used to broadly assess how sample design affects the precision of a particular set of estimates as well as enabling users to manually correct standard errors and confidence intervals produced under the assumption of simple random sampling.\nformally, the \\(D_{eff}\\) is defined as the ratio of the variance of an estimated parameter of interest to the same variance computed under the assumption of simple random sampling.The \\(D_{eft}\\) by contrast is the square root of the Design effect. A \\(D_{eff}\\) with a value \\(&lt;1\\) indicates a smaller variance than under SRS, therefore an improvement in precision, whereas a value \\(&gt;1\\) indicates a loss of precision. Data producers sometimes provide Design factor estimates that can be used to correct standard error or confidence intervals that are biased due to having been computed under an assumption of simple random sampling - that is without using survey design information."

This presents the advantage of enabling large numbers of users to access data with a minimal level of formalities to go through but comes at the significant cost that survey design variables are often not included by data producers, due to concerns about the risk of personal information disclosure. There are notable exceptions, such as Understanding Society, the Health Survey for England or the British National Surveys of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (NATSAL). The British Social Attitudes Survey does also include survey design variables in some of its releases.\nFor a number of key studies such as the Labour Force Survey or the Family Resources Survey, users may apply for access to a version of the data that does include survey design information via the (virtual) SecureLab or at the UKDS Safe Room. Application for access to these facilities can be a lengthy process, and not practically feasible for all researchers, in particular those outside academia or large organisations. More information on Types of data access can be found on the UK Data Service website. There are also a large number of studies for which such controlled access is not available. The consequence is that in a significant number of cases, there will inevitably be limitations to the level of precision of the estimates most will be able to produce."

Reflecting on the stakes of their intended analysis will help users decide how important it is to strive to use the most robust estimation technique available or instead to settle for one that is ‘good enough’. Typical usages of survey data could be seen as lying on a continuum ranging from ‘playing with the data’ to producing numbers that will be subject to public scrutiny, or that will be used in policymaking. The latter require such a degree of precision – for example when publishing official population estimates or writing a research article, other less so – for instance when exploring data or preparing examples for teaching. In the former cases, users may simply need to get a rough idea of a population estimate or the interval within which it may lie."

    "text": "3.3 Complexity of the analysis\nWhat an analysis actually entails will help determine whether accessing survey design variables is crucial or not. Estimation involving a small numbers of observations will be more at risk of providing incorrect estimates if survey design variables are not taken into account. Similarly, interest for specific subgroups of the population (also known as domains) rather than the population as a whole will involve more complex estimation techniques as domain estimation needs to account for the distribution of weights in the whole population, not just for the subgroup of interest.\nAgain, these analytical scenarios could be seen as lying on a continuum ranging from producing simple univariate descriptive estimates for the population as a whole to complex estimation of small groups characteristics and/or multivariate analysis. The former is conceptually and practically more straightforward than the latter. In some cases the estimates of interest may already have been published by the data producer using the adequate estimation techniques and the full information available. Data producers may also have published design factors i.e. numbers allowing to adjust the precision of estimates produced without survey design variables. Examples of such design factors for the Labour Force Survey and the Family Resources Surveys are provided below."

However, most statistical software also have options for directly weighting estimation commands outside of procedures accounting for survey design. Solely relying on weighted commands without explicitly declaring the survey design, potentially raises the following issues:\n\nWhereas weighted commands will most of the time compute the correct point estimates, they will also silently produce biased estimates of their precision (standard errors or confidence intervals), based on the incorrect assumption that the sample was collect via simple random sampling. Depending on the survey design, this will lead to under- or over- estimation of standard errors and confidence intervals, and could affect the validity of statistical tests, in particular if small groups within the population are involved.\nIn addition, there are specific cases where estimation of standard errors and confidence intervals will be not just biased but wholly incorrect: the standard (i.e. command-based) weighting procedure of SPSS and SAS relies on population rather than sample totals to compute them, which results in unrealistic values.\nSoftware such as Stata does not allow users to directly compute confidence intervals or use sampling weights outside of survey commands. This may lead users to rely on ‘quick and dirty’ tricks that will help them quickly produce weighted point estimates, with incorrect standard errors."

    "text": "3.5 What are we in fact estimating?\nUsers can choose to prioritise producing weighted point estimates over estimating their precision and the factors that influence it - chiefly survey design variables. It can be tempting to consider that the goal of statistical inference mainly consists in producing ‘representative’ point estimates of a quantity of interest such as the ‘mean weight of adult males’, the ‘median poverty rate’, or the value of some regression coefficient in a multivariate study with estimates of their precision a secondary consideration, or a qualifier of the point estimate.\nThis is potentially risky. Point estimates can be at the same time representative and imprecise, and therefore carry little practical meaning. It could also be argued that focusing too narrowly on single value population estimates implicitly entertains the idea that such unique, ‘true’ value exist. As these in fact constantly vary, different surveys will return inevitably different estimates.\nInstead, conceiving from the start these two aspects as a single reality – a range of plausible values we think a parameter of interest can take in the population, with a certain degree of confidence – could help alleviate such a risk and most importantly provide a more accurate reflection of the reality we seek to describe. Striving to produce confidence intervals whenever it makes sense to do so will help the notion that precision and therefore inevitably survey design are key to robust estimation."

Information about how to apply for Secure Lab Access is available on the UKDS website.\nIf the survey design variables such as strata, cluster, or primary sampling unit are not available an alternative workflow could consist of:\n\nIf the user is interested in overall population characteristics, checking whether the estimates of interest may already have been published by the data producer, in which case they may be directly cited instead of computed from data.\nFinding out about the survey design in the data documentation and identify the survey weights variable\nDeclaring the survey design as simple random sampling using software-specific commands\nProducing the estimates of interest, using survey design specific estimation commands available\nChecking whether the data producer has published design effects that could be used to remedy biased confidence intervals/ standards errors computed without survey design variables (for example design effects computed for the same population at another point in time). A design effect is a number by which to multiply standard errors estimated under the assumption of simple random sampling, that will adjust it for survey design characteristics.\nDocumenting the resulting confidence interval for the estimate of interest or alternatively the point estimates and its standard error.\nIf no design effects are available for the estimates of interest, an explicit mention of the likely nature and cause of bias is good practice i.e. under estimation in case of cluster sampling, over estimation in case of stratified sample, usually available from the survey documentation. The wider the initial confidence interval (i.e. computed under SRS assumptions) the larger the likely bias. Or from another perspective, the smaller the (sub)sample, the larger the likely bias. In cases of conducting significance testing with small subsample or groups, it would be a good practice to only consider test outcomes significant at or .\n\nComputing estimates for subpopulations (also known as ‘domains’) rather than for the population as a whole requires extra precautions. This is the case for example when we are interested in the mean age by employment status, or some other categories, or alternatively, in analyses restricted to a subset of the population (for example only those in employment). The key difference is that when computing domain estimates we are in fact producing estimates about a group of the population whose size we also need to estimate. This requires ensuring that the whole distribution of weights in the sample is taken into account, not just the weight values for the groups we are interested in. Failure to do so might result in computing incorrect point estimates and standard errors/confidence intervals. Survey specific commands in statistical software are designed to tackle this potential issue."

Most of these will provide the correct point estimate. By default however, some statistical software will also provide an estimate of standard errors or confidence intervals, which is likely to be misleading as they ‘silently’ assume simple random sampling, and in some cases will carry out computation with population (i.e. grossed) totals, resulting in incorrect values."

They key point is that as weights were designed using the whole of the sample, computing estimates, in particular confidence intervals or standard errors for part of the sample, therefore using a fraction of these weights may affect the estimates. Instead, it is recommended to use commands that take into account the entire distribution of the weights.\nIn R, the command that does this is svyby()\nFor instance, if we would like to compute the mean age of BSA respondents by Government Office Regions, we need to specify:\n\nThe outcome variable whose estimate we want to compute: i.e. RAgeE\nThe grouping variable(s) GOR_ID\nThe estimate function we are going to use here: svymean, the same as we used before\nAnd the type of type of variance estimation we would like to see displayed i.e. standard errors or confidence interval\n\n\nround(\n      svyby(~RAgeE,by=~as_factor(GOR_ID),svymean,design=bsa17.s,vartype = \"ci\")[-1]\n      ,1)\n\n                           RAgeE ci_l ci_u\nA North East                46.1 43.6 48.6\nB North West                49.6 47.3 52.0\nD Yorkshire and The Humber  48.0 45.2 50.8\nE East Midlands             48.6 45.9 51.3\nF West Midlands             48.1 45.0 51.2\nG East of England           49.0 46.0 52.0\nH London                    45.0 43.0 46.9\nJ South East                48.0 45.1 50.8\nK South West                53.4 51.5 55.2\nL Wales                     49.1 45.1 53.1\nM Scotland                  47.3 44.7 50.0\n\n\nNote: we used [-1] from the object created by svyby() in order to remove a column with alphanumeric values (the region names), so that we could round the results without getting an error.\nOur inference seem to suggest that the population in London is among the youngest in the country, and that those in the South West are among the oldest – their respective 95% confidence intervals do not overlap. We should not feel so confident about differences between London and the South East for example, as the CIs partially overlap.\nWe can follow a similar approach with proportions: we just need to specify the category of the variable we are interested in as an outcome, for instance respondents who are significantly interested in politics, and replace svymean by svyciprop.\n\nround(\n      100*\n      svyby(~I(Politics==1 | Politics==2),\n            by=~as_factor(GOR_ID),\n            svyciprop,\n            design=bsa17.s,\n            vartype = \"ci\")[-1],\n            1)\n\n                           I(Politics == 1 | Politics == 2) ci_l ci_u\nA North East                                           33.4 26.6 40.9\nB North West                                           41.9 36.1 48.0\nD Yorkshire and The Humber                             35.6 29.1 42.6\nE East Midlands                                        36.9 32.9 41.1\nF West Midlands                                        36.3 31.5 41.5\nG East of England                                      47.2 41.4 53.1\nH London                                               54.2 47.2 61.1\nJ South East                                           44.6 38.7 50.8\nK South West                                           46.5 39.4 53.8\nL Wales                                                38.6 27.7 50.7\nM Scotland                                             42.7 36.0 49.8\n\n\nQuestion 5 What is the 95% confidence interval for the proportion of people interested in politics in the South West?

Primary sampling units were stratified according to geographies (sub regions), population density, and proportion of owner-occupiers. Sampling rate was proportional to the size of postcode sectors (i.e. number of addresses).\nQuestion 2 From the Data Dictionary it appears that the primary sampling units (sub regions) are identified by Spoint and the strata by StratID. The weights variable is WtFactor. Addresses are not provided but could be approximated with a household identifier.\nQuestion 3 Not using weights would make us overestimate the mean age in the population (of those aged 16+) by about 4 years. This is likely to be due to the fact that older respondents are more likely to take part to surveys. Using survey design variables does not alter the value of the estimated population mean. However, not accounting for it would lead us to overestimate the precision/underestimate the uncertainty of our estimate with a narrower confidence interval – by about plus or minus 3 months.\nQuestion 4 The proportion of 17-34 year old in the sample is 28.5 and its 95% confidence interval 26.5, 30.6\nQuestion 5 The 95% confidence interval for the proportion of people interested in politics in the South West is 39.8-53.4. By contrast, it is 47.6-60.8 in London. The region with the lowest precision of estimates (i.e. the widest confidence interval) is Wales, with a 20 percentage point difference between the upper and lower bounds of the confidence interval.\nQuestion 6\n\n\n             I(Politics.s == \"Significantly\") ci_l ci_u\n17-34.Male                               42.9 37.7 48.2\n35-54.Male                               50.8 46.6 54.9\n55+.Male                                 57.8 53.9 61.6\n17-34.Female                             26.3 22.0 31.1\n35-54.Female                             34.1 30.6 37.8\n55+.Female                               43.0 39.6 46.5\n\n\nOlder respondents both male and female tend to be more involved in politics than younger ones.\nThe confidence interval for the proportion of men under 35 and women above 55 interested in politics overlaps; it is unlikely that they differ in the population."

    "text": "6.5 Domain (i.e. subpopulation) estimates\nAlthough computing estimates for specific groups (for example the average age of people who report being interested in politics) is not conceptually different from doing it for the sample as a whole, doing it with weights as part of an inferential analysis requires some caution. Calculating weighted estimates for a subpopulation while the rest of the sample is left out of the analysis might yield incorrect results. This is why using survey design informed functions is particularly recommended when doing such analyses.\nThe SPSS command CSDESCRIPTIVES that we used above makes such domain estimation relatively straightforward. If we would like to compute the mean age of BSA respondents by government office regions, we need to specify:\n\nThe outcome variable whose estimate we want to compute: i.e. RAgeE\nThe grouping variable(s) GOR_ID\nAnd the type of type of variance estimation we would like to see displayed i.e. standard errors or confidence interval\n\n * Complex Samples Descriptives.\nCSDESCRIPTIVES\n  /PLAN FILE='bsa17_SPSS_design.csaplan'\n  /SUMMARY VARIABLES=RAgeE\n  /SUBPOP TABLE=GOR_ID DISPLAY=LAYERED\n  /MEAN\n  /STATISTICS CIN(95)\n  /MISSING SCOPE=ANALYSIS CLASSMISSING=EXCLUDE.\n\nOur inference seem to suggest that the population in London is among the youngest in the country, and that those in the South West are among the oldest – their respective 95% confidence intervals do not overlap. We should not feel so confident about differences between London and the South East for example, as the CIs partially overlap.\nWe can also examine proportions for subpopulations. In order to do this, we need to specify the category of the variable we are interested in as an outcome. For instance, the syntax below uses respondents who are significantly interested in politics:\n* Complex Samples Frequencies.\nCSTABULATE\n  /PLAN FILE='bsa17_SPSS_design.csaplan'\n  /TABLES VARIABLES=Politics.s\n  /SUBPOP TABLE=GOR_ID DISPLAY=LAYERED\n  /CELLS TABLEPCT\n  /STATISTICS CIN(95) \n  /MISSING SCOPE=TABLE CLASSMISSING=EXCLUDE.\nQuestion 5 What is the 95% confidence interval for the proportion of people interested in politics in the South West? Is the proportion likely to be different in London? In what way? What is the region of the UK for which the precision of the estimates is likely to be the smallest?\nWhen using CSTABULATE, we can define domains or subpopulations with several variables, not just one. For example, we could look at gender differences in political affiliations by regions. However, as the size of subgroups decrease, so does the precision of the estimates as their confidence interval widens, to a point where their substantive interest is not meaningful anymore.\nQuestion 6 Using interest in politics as before, and three category age RAgecat5:\n\nProduce a table of results showing the proportion of respondents significantly interested in Politics by age group and gender\nAssess whether the age difference in interest for politics is similar for each gender?\nBased on the data, is it fair to say that men aged under 35 tend to be more likely to declare themselves interested in politics than women aged 55 and above?\n\nCSTABULATE\n  /PLAN FILE='bsa17_SPSS_design.csaplan'\n  /TABLES VARIABLES=Politics.s\n  /SUBPOP TABLE=Rsex BY RAgecat5 DISPLAY=LAYERED\n  /CELLS TABLEPCT\n  /STATISTICS CIN(95) \n  /MISSING SCOPE=TABLE CLASSMISSING=EXCLUDE.\n\nAnswers\nQuestion 1 The 2017 BSA is a three stage stratified random survey, with postcode sectors, adresses and individuals as the units selected at each stage. Primary sampling units were stratified according to geographies (sub regions), population density, and proportion of owner-occupiers. Sampling rate was proportional to the size of postcode sectors (i.e. number of addresses).\nQuestion 2 From the Data Dictionary it appears that the primary sampling units (sub regions) are identified by Spoint and the strata by StratID. The weights variable is WtFactor. Addresses are not provided but could be approximated with a household identifier.\nQuestion 3 Not using weights would make us overestimate the mean age in the population (of those aged 16+) by about 4 years. This is likely to be due to the fact that older respondents are more likely to take part to surveys. Using survey design variables does not alter the value of the estimated population mean. However, not accounting for it would lead us to overestimate the precision/underestimate the uncertainty of our estimate with a narrower confidence interval – by about plus or minus 3 months.\nQuestion 4 The proportion of 17-34 year old in the sample is 28.5 and its 95% confidence interval 26.5, 30.6\nQuestion 5 The 95% confidence interval for the proportion of people interested in politics in the South West is 39.8-53.4. By contrast, it is 47.6-60.8 in London. The region with the lowest precision of estimates (i.e. the widest confidence interval) is Wales, with a 20 percentage point difference between the upper and lower bounds of the confidence interval.\nQuestion 6\n\n\n             I(Politics.s == \"Significantly\") ci_l ci_u\n17-34.Male                               42.9 37.7 48.2\n35-54.Male                               50.8 46.6 54.9\n55+.Male                                 57.8 53.9 61.6\n17-34.Female                             26.3 22.0 31.1\n35-54.Female                             34.1 30.6 37.8\n55+.Female                               43.0 39.6 46.5\n\n\nOlder respondents both male and female tend to be more involved in politics than younger ones.\nThe confidence interval for the proportion of men under 35 and women above 55 interested in politics overlaps; it is unlikely that they differ in the population."
