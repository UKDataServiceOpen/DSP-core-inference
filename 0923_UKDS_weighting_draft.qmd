# Introduction {-}
This note aims at setting out guidelines for population inference using weights and survey design variables with UK Data Service social surveys. It focuses on providing users with practical procedures for safe estimation and only discuss the  theoretical underpinnings of survey design, sampling or estimation with  weighted survey data where it is necessary. The content is based on technical documents by data producers such as the Office for National Statistics as well as the relevant statistical literature. Examples are currently drawn from the Labour Force Survey, the Family Expenditure Survey and the British Social Attitudes survey and will be gradually be expanded.  A list of key references and online tutorials is provided in the bibliography. 

Social surveys are data collection exercises that produce datasets enabling researchers and analysts to learn about the characteristics of human populations and societies. This is achieved by way of conducting statistical inference, the process through which unknown quantities (sometimes called parameters) of such ‘large’ populations are estimated with the help of  samples that are drawn from them. Estimation of population parameters traditionally consists of computing two pieces of information: a measure of a value of interest also known as point estimate, such as a mean or a median, together with an indication of its degree of uncertainty or precision (as standard error). Alternatively, one could also decide to represent likely values of population estimates explicitly as a range of values or interval. 

It has been demonstrated that when certain conditions are met, such as when samples are randomly drawn and sample size is large enough, surveys and the parameter estimates inferred from them are representative of the corresponding population [@Lohr20192010]. Robust, unbiased estimates are estimates that are not only *representative* -- they reflect the characteristic of interest in the population, but also  *precise* enough for the inference to be meaningful. Unfortunately, in part as a result of design decisions, in part – and increasingly so – due to non response, raw, ie uncorrected, population estimates from real-world social surveys present some degree of bias.

It is usually considered that in order to produce robust population estimates from potentially biased samples, including as much of the survey design information as possible alongside (non response and sampling) weights is required.  Conversely, estimates computed without weights or accounting for survey design will at best present some degree of bias  or even might be altogether unreliable. Computing weighted estimates and accounting for survey design requires specific procedures that are not usually very well documented as  the relevant statistical techniques are more complex and overlooked in introductory  textbooks, and their practical implementation in statistical software may not always be clear. It is therefore necessary to add some clarity to this situation and provide  adequate guidelines in order for  users of UKDS data to properly implement  robust estimation strategies that are adapted to their needs, which is the purpose of this document. 

# 1. Basics of Survey Design
At the core of survey design are the strategies used to collect samples. Sample units can either be selected randomly, an approach also known as probability sampling, or not - for example when internet users are taking part to an online poll. Random sampling is usually preferred as it minimises the risk of obtaining non representative or biased samples - for example where certain groups of the population are under represented or altogether excluded. Statistical textbooks usually consider that simple random sampling - simply drawing population members at random - is the best way to obtain a random sample and avoid bias. This is however difficult to achieve in practice  with real life social surveys. Simple random sampling requires a sampling frame ie ideally a list of all members of the population of interest. In countries without a national register - a database of all residents - such a list does not exist and needs to be approximated by other means which may be costly to achieve. Simple random sampling can also not be optimal when groups within the population are known to have different probabilities of taking part in surveys.  

In practice designing surveys entails striking a balance between maximising representativeness as well as sample size (for greater precision of the results) while keeping costs down. For these reasons, large scale social surveys tend to produce random samples via other means than simple random sampling. Techniques are employed for example, to ensure each country  of the UK is correctly represented, which may might involve taking separate samples for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and that certain sub-groups, for example the ethnic minorities, are adequately represented.   

Two common survey design techniques employed  are *clustering* and *stratification*. 

## 1.1 Clustering
Clustering usually goes hand in hand with multistage sampling, that is drawing sample units in several stages rather than all at once. It consists of dividing the population into groups that are as internally heterogeneous as possible - one could think of them as 'mini populations', some of which are then randomly selected while others are left out. 

**The UK context**

In Great-Britain, the closest list that comes to a population register that can be used as a sampling frame is a list of addresses kept by Royal Mail, also know as the Postcode Address File (PAF). For Northern Ireland the most commonly used is the Land and Property Services Agency’s (LPSA). As a list of addresses, the PAF cannot be used to draw a simple random sample of either households or individuals as the number of dwellings, households and individuals at each address in not indicated.   

The  nature of the  PAF address structure easily enables geographical clustering in UK surveys. Addresses, or ’delivery points’ cluster into larger units, for example  the post code M13 9PL is embedded within the the M13  ‘post code district’ and the M13 9  ‘postcode sector’.  Survey designs often use either postcode sectors or districts as Primary Sampling Units (PSUs) to reduce fieldwork costs and time.  


![Figure 1: Clustering in two stage sampling](pics/cluster.png)


Figure 1 provides a simplified illustration of clustering with four districts as Primary Sampling Units (PSUs). The dotted lines indicate that districts 1 and 4 have been selected to be in the sample. A second stage of sampling follows, where households are samples from within the two sampled districts. As a result, of this design we obtain a sample of households but these households are clustered within a sample of districts. Subsequent drawing of either further clusters or final sample members takes place within the already selected clusters. These higher level clusters, ie those at which the first random draw happened as known as  Primary Sampling Units (PSUs). In large scale surveys the PSUs are often geographical areas. 


**Household level clustering**

A lesser discussed aspect of clustering arises if all individuals at a sampled household are selected. Imagine we are estimating the proportion of individuals who are born outside the UK from a population of 100 people who live in 50 households. We would expect people who are born outside the UK to be more likely to live together than if they were scattered randomly across all households. Instead, we will find them ‘clustered’ within households, with some households being wholly overseas born, some mixed and most wholly UK born. 

e.g. 
```
Household 1: 1 UK born individuals 
Household 2: 3 UK born 
Household 3: 2 Overseas born 
Household 4: 6 UK born 
Household 5: 1 Overseas born, 1 UK born 
Household 6: 2 UK born 
Household 7: 1 UK born 
Household 8: 1 UK born 
Household 9: 5 Overseas born 
Household 10: 3 UK born 
```
And so on… 


This clustering within households means that if we are selecting only one in ten of the households for our sample we might expect the sample to be less accurate in predicting the proportion of our population who were born outside the UK than if we had sampled individuals at random.   

More generally, using clustering comes at the cost of making the sampling coarser in the sense that we are shrinking the size of the population from which it is going to be drawn - reducing its diversity - which in turn makes the estimates produced from the resulting data less precise. We will come back to this in the next section.


 <!-- For example, in the case of the Labour Force Survey sample design, there is a clustering effect. This reflects the fact that addresses are sampled, but that results are shown for individuals. For example, ethnicity is particularly clustered, since it is likely that all members of a household living at a particular address will share the same ethnicity. This results in, for example, the design factor for the ’Asian or Asian British’ group being 1.74, which is higher than for the other ethnic groups because of the tendency for Asian ethnic groups to live in large households. The design factor for part-time employees on the other hand is 0.98, reflecting the fact that part-time employee status is not clustered within a household.  -->

## 1.2 Stratification
 In stratified sampling, the population is divided into groups, or strata, and a sample of units is selected from each. Stratified sampling ensures the sample includes a certain proportion of units from the selected groups that may have been missed otherwise. By contrast with clustering strata are constructed so as to maximise their internal homogeneity.

![Figure 2: An example of stratified sampling](pics/strata.png)


Figure 2 provides a simplified example where the population is divided into four strata: North, South, East and West. Within each strata five sampling units (represented by houses) are selected.  

Common stratification characteristics used in UK surveys are geographical (e.g. Government Office Regions); socio-economic (e.g. proportion of people in the area in certain  occupations; car ownership) or demographic (e.g. proportion of people who are pensioners, population density). Such information is usually obtained from Census data.

It is considered that overall stratification, by improving the representativeness of potentially less represented or harder to reach groups, increases the precision of surveys.

## 1.3 Proportionate vs  non proportionate stratification

In  simple random sampling, each element drawn from the sampling frame has an equal selection probability, therefore the sampling fraction is $n/N$, with $n$ the sample size and N the population size. This can  either be achieved by directly selecting sample units at random or by choosing a random start and an interval.  

In the context of stratified sampling,  *proportionate stratification* refers to a case where the same sampling fraction is used for elements within all stratum: ie $n_h/N_h$. We can see this in Figure 2  as the same proportion of units is selected for all strata with a sampling fraction of $1/4$.   

It is sometimes necessary to use  *disproportionate stratification* where the sampling fraction varies across strata. This method is used to increase the numbers of a specific group in the population and is useful when a sub-population of interest is numerically small, like less populated areas or ethnic minority groups. In such a case, $n_h/N_h>n_{h+1}/N_{h+1}$: the sampling fraction in stratum $h$ is larger ie we are proportionally drawing more units in that stratum relative to its size, than in stratum $h+1$. For example, for the British Election Study 2010, respondents from an ethnic minority background were over-sampled as too little was known about ethnic minority voting behaviour.  Disproportionate stratification will mean some groups are over-represented in the sample.  


# 2 Design-based inference from social surveys 

As we have just seen, collecting data about people at random is not necessarily straightforward to achieve. There is no such thing as a sampling frame - a list of all UK residents to pick from - and even if there were one, some people would be less likely to take part to survey than others. As a result most UK social surveys rely on sampling techniques such as multi-stage clustering and stratification, alongside sampling proportionate to size. These design techniques are used to strike a compromise between issues such as tackling non response, unequal probability of selection, improving the representativeness of hard to reach groups while keeping fieldwork costs down. 

Conducting inference consists of estimating parameters - quantities of interest from surveys, whether point estimates such as means or median and/or measures of their degree of precision such as confidence intervals or standard errors. Both are  potentially affected by the sample design that was implemented during data collection, and need to be adapted accordingly. It is generally accepted that by increasing the sampling fraction for groups, stratification improves the precision of estimates, whereas by in effect removing part of the population from the sample, clustering will negatively impact precision. Since most survey use a combination of both, the impact of survey design will depend on the quantity and the subgroups of the population estimated, if any. Furthermore using weights to reflect non-response or unequal probability of selection also affects the precision of estimations - often negatively - and this should ideally be also taken into account when computing estimates.   

Traditional textbooks or introductory courses tend to leave out this aspect, which may give a false impression of simplicity to users. There are traditionally two main ways to produce population estimates from surveys while accounting for sample design: either by directly using methods that correct estimates for the characteristics of the sample - also known a *design-based estimation* - or by modelling the effect of sample design - the *model-based approach*. Both have advantages and downsides, but for now we will only focus on the design based approach as it tends to be more straightforward to use.     

## 2.1 Survey design variables

*Weights* are a special type of numeric variable included in survey datasets, whose value tends to be the inverse of the relative 'importance' of sampled observations [reword]. They are designed to prevent estimates from being biased, that is  reflecting a value that is not representative of the population. They are usually made of at least two components:

- a *design* component that accounts for issues of unequal probability of selection of sample members resulting from survey design;

- a *non-response* component, correcting for (known) lower propensity to take part to surveys among certain categories of respondents. 

These components are sometimes labelled 'weights' in their own right, but in practice they are usually merged into a single variable.

Survey weights may also be rescaled in order to inflate sample counts to population totals thus becoming *grossing weights* which enables estimation of population size. In that sense, the numerical values of the weights attached to observations are an indication of the number of units these observation ‘represent’ in the population. 

Computation of weights rely on calibration algorithms that optimise the conditional distribution of the weighting variables given the sample size (for example the conditional distribution of people by age, gender and economic status) with a view to strike a balance between minimising standard errors and maximising representativeness. [**reword - hard to understand**]

*Survey design variables* typically consist of identifiers for the strata and/or clusters used when the sample was drawn, especially the Primary Sampling Units (PSU). Used in conjunction with weights, they enable researchers to produce more accurate estimates. However, whereas most surveys curated by the UK Data Service include weights, survey design variables are not always provided by data producers due to data protection concerns.

## 2.2 Design effects and design factors 
In the absence of survey design variables, *Design effects* (also know as DEFF or $D_{eff}$) and/or Design factors ($D_{eft}$) may provide a partial solution to the problem of how to account for survey design. $D_{eff}$ and $D_{eft}$ are two versions of a coefficient which attempts to measure the extent to which the standard error of an estimate given the current survey design differs from what it would have been under simple random sampling [@Kish1995]. They can therefore be used to broadly assess how sample design affects the precision of a particular set of estimates as well as enabling users to manually correct standard errors and confidence intervals produced under the assumption of simple random sampling. 

Formally, the  $D_{eff}$ is defined as the ratio of the variance of an estimated parameter of interest to the same variance computed under the assumption of simple random sampling.The $D_{eft}$ by contrast is the square root of the Design Effect. A  $D_{eff}$  with a value $<1$ indicates a smaller variance than under SRS, therefore an improvement in precision, whereas  a value $>1$ indicates a loss of precision. Data producers sometimes provide Design factor estimates that can be used to correct biased standard error or confidence intervals. 


# 3. The practice of inference: things to keep in mind

While the optimum approach to estimating population parameters from surveys relies on using both weights and survey design variables, it is not always possible. In practice, trade-offs have to be made depending on several factors. Let us briefly consider them. 

## 3.1 Data availability

Most UK Data Service datasets are available under *End User License (EUL)*. This presents the advantage of  enabling  large numbers of users  to access data with a minimal level of formalities to go through but comes at the  significant cost  that    survey design variables are often not included by the data producer, due to concerns about the  risk of personal information disclosure. There are notable exceptions, such as for example the British Social Attitudes survey which does include survey design variables in some of its releases. 

For a number of key studies such as the Labour Force Survey or the Family Resources Survey,  users may apply for access to a version of the data that does include survey design information via the (virtual) SecureLab or at the UKDS Safe Room. Application for  access to these facilities can be a lengthy process, and not practically feasible for all researchers, in particular those outside academia or large organisations. More information is available on the [UK Data Service website](https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/help/access-policy/types-of-data-access/). There are also a large number of studies for which such controlled access is not available. The consequence is that in a significant number of cases, there will inevitably be limitations to the level of precision of the estimates most  will be able to produce.

## 3.2 Sensitivity of the analysis

Not all analyses necessarily require the highest degree of precision. Reflecting on the stakes of their intended analysis  will help users decide how important it is to strive to use the most robust estimation technique available or instead to settle for one that is 'good enough'. Typical usages of survey data could be seen as lying on a continuum ranging from 'playing with the data' to producing numbers that will be subject to public scrutiny, or that will be used in policymaking. The latter require such a degree of precision -- for example when publishing official population estimates or writing a research article, other less so -- for instance when exploring data or preparing examples for teaching. In the former cases, users may simply need to get a rough idea of a population estimate or the interval within which it may lie.

## 3.3 Complexity  of the analysis

What an analysis actually entails will help determine whether accessing survey design variables is crucial or not. Estimation involving a small numbers of observations will be more at risk of providing incorrect estimates if survey design variables are not taken into account. Similarly, interest for specific subgroups of the population (also known as domains) rather than the population as a whole will involve more complex estimation techniques as domain estimation needs to account for the distribution of weights in the whole population, not just for the subgroup of interest.

These analytical scenarios could be seen as lying on a continuum ranging from producing simple univariate descriptive estimates for the population as a whole to  complex  estimation  of small groups characteristics and/or multivariate analysis. The former is conceptually and practically more straightforward than the latter. In some cases the estimates of interest may already have been published by the data producer using the adequate estimation techniques and the full information available. Data producers may also have published *design factors* ie numbers allowing to adjust the precision of estimates produced without survey design variables. Examples of such design factors for the Labour Force Survey and the Family Resources Surveys are provided below.


## 3.4 Software issues

Most statistical analysis software include commands specifically designed to analyse survey data: such is the case of the R *Survey*  package, the SPSS *Complex Survey* add-on and Stata's *svy:* set of commands. However, most statistical software also have options for directly weighting estimation commands outside of procedures accounting for survey design. Solely relying on weighted commands without explicitly declaring the survey design, potentially raises the following issues:

- Whereas weighted commands will most of the time compute the correct point estimates, they will  also silently produce biased estimates of their precision (standard errors or confidence intervals), based on the incorrect assumption that the sample was collect via simple random sampling. Depending on the survey design, this will lead to under- or over- estimation of standard errors and confidence intervals, and could affect the validity  of statistical tests, in particular if small groups within the population are involved.

- In addition, there are  specific cases where estimation of standard errors and confidence intervals will be not just biased but wholly incorrect: the standard (ie command-based) weighting procedure  of SPSS and SAS relies on population rather than sample totals to compute them, which results in unrealistic values. 

- Software such as Stata does not allow users to directly compute confidence intervals or use sampling weights outside of survey commands.  This may lead users to rely on 'quick and dirty' tricks that will help them quickly produce weighted point estimates, with incorrect standard errors.


## 3.5 What are we in fact estimating? 

Users can prioritise producing weighted point estimates over estimating their precision and the factors that influence it  - chiefly survey design variables. It can be tempting to consider that the goal of statistical inference mainly consists in producing  'representative' point estimates of a quantity of interest such as the 'mean weight of adult males', the 'median poverty rate', or the value of some regression coefficient in a multivariate study with estimates of their precision a secondary consideration, or a qualifier of the point estimate.  

This is potentially risky.  Point estimates can be at the same time representative *and*  imprecise, and therefore carry little practical meaning. It could also  be argued that focusing too narrowly  on single value population estimates  implicitly   entertains the idea that  such  unique, 'true' value exist. As these in fact constantly vary, different  surveys will return inevitably different estimates. 

Instead, conceiving from the start these two aspects as a single reality -- a range of plausible values   we think a parameter of interest can take in the population, with a certain degree of confidence -- could help alleviate such a risk and most importantly provide a more accurate reflection of the reality we seek to describe. Striving to produce confidence intervals whenever it makes sense to do so will help the notion that precision and therefore inevitably survey design are key to robust estimation. 

# 4. Statistical inference from  survey data in practice
*Ultimately  there should be a flowchart here or in the next section*

This section  provides  practical recommendations for robust inference taking into account the factors highlighted in Section 3. In general, four strategies are available when conducting population inference from survey data.  They are listed below by order of recommendation by the UK Data Service:

1. Estimation accounting for weights and survey design using survey-specific commands
2. Estimation accounting for weights only using survey-specific commands
3. Estimation  using weighted standard commands
4. (Unweighted estimation)

*Strategy 1*, using weights alongside  survey design variables when conducting statistical inference is the statistically most robust way to compute population estimates with survey data and should be prioritised by users whenever possible. In real life research however, this option is not always available. Accessing survey design variables can prove challenging as they are not always provided by data producers or may require applying for a special version of the data, which may prove time consuming.

In the absence of survey design information, *Strategy 2* should be considered the second best option. The value of point estimates are likely to be identical to those produced under Strategy 1, but the confidence intervals/standard errors will be biased -- ie too narrow or wide depending on the survey design, which should be explicitly mentioned alongside the results. The data documentation should provide information about how results may be affected. Using survey-specific  estimation commands even in the absence of survey design variables is a recommended option over simply applying weights to standard commands, as it will avoid getting incorrect estimates (SAS and SPSS), is the only option available for computation with survey weights or obtaining confidence intervals  (Stata), or coherent survey data analysis (R). In addition, it might be possible to correct 'by hand' biased standard errors or confidence interval using data producer-provided design factors. 

It can be understandable that when survey design variables are not available some users privilege *Strategy 3* which tend to  focus on producing weighted estimates using standard commands and  give  little  consideration to the methodological implication of this approach. Whereas point estimates are likely to be identical to those produced under Strategy 1 and 2, SAS and SPSS users are likely to produce incorrect confidence intervals/standard errors. R and Stata users might get standard errors and confidence intervals that are close to those produced using Strategy 2, but there is no guarantee that this will be the case. Overall, the UK Data Service only recommend following this strategy in case of low sensitivity analysis.

As population estimates produced without weights or survey design variables will almost certainly be unreliable *Strategy 4* should be discouraged except when data usage is purely descriptive. For example when teaching non-inferential (ie descriptive) statistical techniques. 


## 4.1 Medium to high sensitivity analysis: workflow

Most of the time survey researchers or data analysts are required to produce a confidence interval or provide an indication of the degree of precision of their point estimate,  usually with standard errors, whose correct estimation  depends on the amount of information held about the survey design.

1. **If survey design variables are  available** a typical workflow (see examples  in Section 5) could involve :
- Finding out about the survey design and identify the relevant weights and survey design variables using the data documentation
- Declaring the survey design using software-specific commands
- Producing the estimates of interest, using survey design specific estimation commands available
- Documenting the confidence interval for the estimate of interest or alternatively the point estimates *and* its standard error.
- If required, provide a brief discussion of the possible source of bias of the results (specifically under/over estimation of the uncertainty of the estimates)

2. If the survey design variables are not included in the EUL version of the data but are available under controlled access: perform a cost vs benefits analysis of  applying for controlled access for instance via the UKDS SecureLab, a process that can take some time. Information about how to apply for Secure Lab Access is available [on the UKDS website](https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/find-data/access-conditions/secure-application-requirements/apply-to-access-ons-data).  

3. If the **survey design variables such as  strata, cluster,  or primary sampling unit are not available** an alternative workflow could consist of:

- If the user is interested in  overall population characteristics, checking  whether the estimates of interest may already have been published by the data producer, in which case they  may be directly cited instead of computed from data.

- Finding out about the survey design in the data documentation and identify the weights variable

- Declaring the survey design as simple random sampling using software-specific commands

- Producing the estimates of interest, using survey design specific estimation commands available

- Checking whether the data producer has published design factors that could  be used  to remedy to biased confidence intervals/ standards errors computed without survey design variables (for example design factors computed for the same population at another point in time).  A design factor is a number by which to multiply standard errors estimated  under the assumption of simple random sampling, that will adjust it for survey design characteristics. 

- Documenting the resulting confidence interval for the estimate of interest or alternatively the point estimates *and* its standard error.

- If no design factors are available for the estimates of interest, an explicit mention of the likely nature and cause of bias is good practice ie under estimation in case of cluster sampling, over estimation in case of stratified sample, usually available from the survey documentation. The wider the initial  confidence interval (ie computed under SRS assumptions) the larger the likely bias. Or from another perspective, the smaller the (sub)sample, the larger the likely bias. In cases of conducting significance testing with small subsample or groups, it would be a good practice to only consider test outcomes significant at P<.01 or p<.001.      

4. Computing estimates for subpopulations (also known as 'domains') rather than for the population as a whole requires extra precautions.  This is the case for example when we are interested in the mean age by employment status, or some other categories, or alternatively, in analyses restricted to a subset of the population (for example only those in employment). The key difference is that when computing domain estimates we are in fact producing estimates about a group of the population whose size we also need to estimate. This requires ensuring that the whole distribution of weights in the sample is taken into account, not just the weight values for the groups we are interested in. Failure to do so might result in computing incorrect point estimates and standard errors/confidence intervals. Survey specific commands in statistical software are designed to tackle this potential issue.

## 4.2 Lower sensitivity analysis
The UK Data Service does not recommend using command-specific or casual weighting for inferential analysis, but there are  circumstances where this will be the only option available to users. There are also cases when users are not interested in knowing about the uncertainty of their estimates (ie their confidence interval, standard errors of point estimates, or conduct statistical testing), for example because they are simply learning or teaching basic statistical concepts or how to use software. 

In such cases,  it can be acceptable to compute point  estimates by applying weights to  commands that accepts them, without using survey design specific functions. Most of these will provide the correct point estimate. By default however, some statistical software will also provide an estimate of standard errors or confidence intervals, which is likely to be  misleading as they 'silently' assume simple random sampling, and in some cases will carry out computation with population (ie grossed)  totals, resulting in incorrect values.



# 5. R examples

The R *Survey* package [@Lumley2023] provides a comprehensive set of functions for computing  point and variance estimates from survey data.  At the same time, R Base does not provide a unified sets of commands or syntax  for computing weighted estimates. Implementation of statistical theory may vary between packages, but algorithms are usually  described in detail in the  package documentation. 

In this example, we will  practice statistical inference with data from the  [2017 British Social Attitudes Survey (BSA)](https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/studies/study?id=8450) taking into account weights and survey design variables. Please note that at the time of writing this document only some issues of the BSA include survey design variables.


## 5.1 Identifying the survey design and variables

We first need to find out about the survey design that was used in the 2017 BSA, and the design variables that are made available in the dataset. Such information can usually be found in the documentation that comes together with the data under the `mrdoc/pdf` folder. 

**Question 1**
What is the design that was used in this survey (ie how many stages were there, and what were the units sampled). What were the primary sampling units; the strata (if relevant)?

Now that we are a bit more familiar with the way the survey was designed, we need to try and identify the design variables we can include when producing estimates. The information can usually be found in the user manual or the data dictionary available under `mrdoc/ukda_data_dictionaries.zip` The file may need to be decompressed  separately.

**Question 2**
What survey design variables are available? Are there any ones that are missing -- if so which ones? What is the name of the weights variables?


## 5.2 Specifying the survey design
```{r 5.1, echo=-9:-7,message=F,warning=F}
rm(list=ls())
library(dplyr) ### Data manipulation functions
library(haven) ### Importing stata/SPSS files

dim(bsa17)
```
We can specify the survey design earlier identified in the data documentation: using `Spoint` as Primary Sampling Unit, `StratID` as strata, and `WtFactor` as weights. R does this by creating a `svydesign` object, ie a survey design informed version of the data, which will be used for  subsequent estimation.

```{r 5.2}
bsa17.s<-svydesign(ids=~Spoint, strata=~StratID, weights=~WtFactor,data=bsa17)
class(bsa17.s)
```

## 5.3 Mean age and its 95% confidence interval
We can now produce a first set of estimates using this information and compare them with those we would have got without accounting for  the survey design. We will compute the average (ie mean) age of respondents in the sample. We will need to use `svymean()`
```{r mean}
svymean(~RAgeE,bsa17.s)
```
 By default  `svymean()` computes the standard error of the mean. We need to  
 embed it within `confint()` in order to get a confidence interval. 
```{r 5.3}
confint(svymean(~RAgeE,bsa17.s)) ### Just the confidence interval...
round(
  c(
    svymean(~RAgeE,bsa17.s),
    confint(svymean(~RAgeE,bsa17.s))
    ),
  1)### Estimate and CI, rounded
```
**Question 3**
What would be the consequences of weighing but not accounting for the sample design; not using  weights and accounting for the sample design when:

- inferring the mean value of the population age?
- inferring the uncertainty  of our estimate of the population age? 

## 5.4 Computing a proportion and its 95% confidence interval
We can now similarly compute the distribution of a categorical variable in the population by estimating proportions (or percentages), for instance, the proportion of people who declare that they are interested in politics. This is the `Politics` variable in the BSA. It has five categories ranging from 1 'A great deal' to 5- 'Not at all'. We could recode 1 and 2 - `quite a lot` into 'Significantly', but since we are only interested in estimating the confidence intervals, we will select the relevant values 'on the go'. 

```{r 5.4}
attr(bsa17$Politics,"label")     ### Phrasing of the question
attr(bsa17$Politics,"labels")     ### Value labels

table(as_factor(bsa17$Politics)) ### Sample distribution

``` 
**Note**: Changes in a data frame are not automatically transferred into `svydesign` objects  used for inferences. We therefore need to recreate it each time  we create or recode a variable.

```{r 5.5}
round(100*prop.table(svytable(~(Politics==1 | Politics==2),bsa17.s)),1)
```

Let us now compute the confidence intervals for  these proportions. Traditional statistical software compute these without giving us an idea of the underlying computations going on. 
Doing this in R requires more coding, but also a better understanding of what is actually estimated. 

Confidence intervals for proportions of categorical variables are usually computed as a sequence of binomial/dichotomic estimations -- ie one for each category. In R this needs to be specified explicitly via the `svyciprop()` and `I()` functions. The former actually computes the proportion and its confidence interval (by default 95%), whereas the latter allows us to define the category we are focusing on.

```{r 5.6}
svyciprop(~I(Politics==1 | Politics==2),bsa17.s)
round(100*
        c(prop.table(svytable(~(Politics==1 | Politics==2),bsa17.s))[2],
attr(svyciprop(~I(Politics==1 | Politics==2),bsa17.s),"ci")),1
)
```                     

**Question 4**
What is the proportion of respondents aged 17-34 in the sample, as well as its 95% confidence interval? You can use ```RAgecat5```


## 5.5 Computing domain estimates
Computing domain estimates, that is estimates for subgroups adds a layer of complexity to the above example. They key point is that as weights were designed using the whole of the sample, computing estimates, in particular confidence intervals or standard errors for part of the sample, therefore using a fraction of these weights may affect the estimates. Instead, it is recommended to use commands that take into account the entire distribution of the weights.

In R, the command that does this is `svyby()`

For instance, if we would like to compute the mean age of BSA respondents by Government Office Regions, we need to specify:

- The outcome variable whose estimate we want to compute: ie `RAgeE`
- The grouping variable(s) `GOR_ID`
- The estimate function we are going to use here: `svymean`, the same as  we used before
- And the type of type of variance estimation we would like to see displayed ie standard errors or confidence interval  

```{r 5.7}
round(
      svyby(~RAgeE,by=~as_factor(GOR_ID),svymean,design=bsa17.s,vartype = "ci")[-1]
      ,1)
```
 *Note:* we used `[-1]` from the object created by `svyby()` in order to remove a column with alphanumeric values (the region names), so that we could round the results without getting an error.
 
 Our inference seem to suggest that the population in  London is among the youngest in the country, and that those in the South West are among the oldest -- their respective 95% confidence intervals do not overlap. We should not feel  so confident about differences between London and the South East for example, as the CIs partially overlap.  

 We can follow a similar approach with proportions: we just need to specify the category of the variable we are interested in as an outcome, for instance respondents who are significantly interested in politics, and replace `svymean` by `svyciprop`.

```{r 5.8}
round(
      100*
      svyby(~I(Politics==1 | Politics==2),
            by=~as_factor(GOR_ID),
            svyciprop,
            design=bsa17.s,
            vartype = "ci")[-1],
            1)
```
**Question 5**
What is the 95% confidence interval for the proportion of people interested in politics in the South West? Is the proportion likely to be different in London? In what way? What is the region of the UK for which the precision of the estimates is likely to be the smallest?

 **Question 6**
Using interest in politics as before, and three category age 
`RAgecat5`: 

- Produce a table of results showing the proportion of respondents significantly interested in Politics by age group and gender


- Assess whether the age difference in interest for politics is similar for each gender?

- Based on the data, is it fair to say that men aged under 35 tend to  be more likely to declare  themselves  interested  in politics  than women aged 55 and above?


## 5.6 Inference without survey design variables using R

*Example: count and proportion of the regional population of the UK using the LFS with End User License (EUL)*

As a rule, EUL versions of the LFS do not include sample design variables. On the other hand they  come with  two weight variables:

- `pwt22` for estimation with the whole sample
- `piwt22` for estimation using  respondents currently in employment (typically used for earnings estimation) 

Estimation without  accounting for sample design will likely be biased and should be reported as such including warnings, even if the nature (over or underestimation of the precision) and and size are not known. An alternative is to look for   design effects tables published by the data producer which could be used to correct for the bias.

The Office for National Statistics regularly publishes such tables for the LFS, albeit mostly for their headline statistics. Obtaining further design effects for subpopulations might not be straighforward. The overall methodology is described  [in this note](https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/methodologicalpublications/generalmethodology/onsworkingpaperseries/onsmethodologyworkingpaperseriesno9guidetocalculatingstandarderrorsforonssocialsurveys#annex-a-labour-force-survey-standard-errors-january-to-march-2015-united-kingdom), and updated tables are provided [on this page](Volume 1: Background and methodology (PDF, 1.2MB)).

Let's see how this can be achieved. But first, let's produce uncorrected 'naive' estimates of the regional population.
    
```{r  5.9}
lfs<-read_dta("~/Dropbox/work/UKDS/data/UKDA-8999-stata/lfsp_aj22_eul_pwt22.dta")%>%select(PWT22,PIWT22,URESMC,ILODEFR)
names(lfs)<-tolower(names(lfs))
lfs$uresmc.f<-droplevels(as_factor(lfs$uresmc))
lfs.s<-svydesign(ids=~1,weights=~piwt22,data=lfs%>%filter(ilodefr==1)) 
round(confint(svytotal(~uresmc.f,lfs.s)))
```

In the above example, we are working with the  most commonly used flavour of the Labour Force Survey: the quarterly edition. The specific dataset used above is the April-July 2022 issue. Looking at the latest version of the documentation mentioned above -  Volume 1, Annex C, we can see a list of design effects for the number of employed respondents by Region of Usual Residence.  

![Test](pics/lfs_vol1_SE.png)

We can see that for some reason, the number of regions has been reduced from the original 16 to 13. We therefore need to recode our original variable.

```{r 5.10}
lfs<-lfs%>%mutate(uresmc.fn=case_when(
          lfs$uresmc.f=="Tyne & Wear" | lfs$uresmc.f== "Rest of Northern region"~"North East",
          lfs$uresmc.f=="South Yorkshire" | lfs$uresmc.f== "West Yorkshire" | lfs$uresmc.f== "Rest of Yorks & Humberside" ~"Yorkshire & Humberside",
          lfs$uresmc.f=="Inner London" | lfs$uresmc.f== "Outer London"~"London",
          lfs$uresmc.f=="West Midlands (met county)" | lfs$uresmc.f== "Rest of West Midlands"~"West Midlands",
          lfs$uresmc.f=="Greater Manchester" | lfs$uresmc.f== "Rest of North West"~"North West",
          lfs$uresmc.f=="Strathclyde" | lfs$uresmc.f== "Rest of Scotland"~"Scotland",
          .default=uresmc.f
          ))
```
For convenience,  reorder the factor levels in order to match the ONS ordering:

```{r 5.11}

lfs$uresmc.fn<-as.factor(lfs$uresmc.fn)
lfs$uresmc.fn<-factor(lfs$uresmc.fn,levels = levels(lfs$uresmc.fn)[c(5,6,4,13,2,12,1,3,8,10,11,9,7)])
```

Let us now check the results:

```{r 5.12}
lfs.s<-svydesign(ids=~1,weights=~piwt22,data=lfs%>%filter(ilodefr==1)) 
round(confint(svytotal(~uresmc.fn,lfs.s)))
```

We can now import the design factors from the LFS documentation. This has to be done by hand, by directly copying the relevant numbers from the LFS. 


While we are at it we can also improve the original table:
```{r 5.13}
tot<-data.frame(svytotal(~uresmc.fn,lfs.s))
tot$deft<-c(0.8712,1.0857,1.3655,1.0051,0.9634,1.0382,0.8936,1.3272,0.9677,0.9137,1.0012,1.0437,0.7113)
tot["2.5%"]<-tot$total-(1.96*tot$SE*tot$deft)
tot["97.5%"]<-tot$total+(1.96*tot$SE*tot$deft)
rownames(tot)<-substr(rownames(tot),10,nchar(rownames(tot)))
kable(round(tot[,c("2.5%","97.5%")]))
```




### Answers

**Question 1**
The 2017 BSA is a three stage stratified random survey, with postcode sectors, adresses and individuals as the units selected at each stage. Primary sampling units were  stratified according to geographies (sub regions), population density, and proportion of owner-occupiers. Sampling rate was proportional to the size of postcode sectors (ie number of addresses).

**Question 2**
From the Data Dictionary it appears that the primary sampling units (sub regions) are identified by `Spoint` and the strata by `StratID`. The weights variable is `WtFactor`. Addresses are not provided but could be approximated with a household identifier. 

**Question 3**
Not using weights would make us overestimate the mean age in the population (of those aged 16+) by about 4 years. This is likely to be due to the fact that older respondents are more likely to take part to surveys. Using  survey design variables does not alter the value of the estimated population mean. However, not accounting for it  would lead us to overestimate the precision/underestimate the uncertainty of our estimate with a narrower confidence interval -- by about plus or minus 3 months. 


**Question 4**
The proportion of 17-34 year old in the sample is `r round(100*as.numeric(svyciprop(~I(RAgecat5 == 1),bsa17.s)[1]),1)` and its 95% confidence interval `r round(100*attr(svyciprop(~I(RAgecat5 == 1),bsa17.s),"ci"),1)`

**Question 5** 
The 95% confidence interval for the proportion of people interested in politics in the South West is 39.8-53.4. By contrast, it is 47.6-60.8 in London. The region with the lowest precision of estimates (ie the widest confidence interval) is Wales, with a  20  percentage point difference between the upper and lower bounds of the confidence interval.


**Question 6**

```{r 5.14,echo=F}
bsa17$Politics.s<-ifelse(bsa17$Politics==1 | bsa17$Politics==2,"Significantly",NA)
bsa17$Politics.s<-ifelse(bsa17$Politics>=3 & bsa17$Politics<=5,"Not Interested",bsa17$Politics.s)
bsa17$Politics.s<-as.factor(bsa17$Politics.s)

bsa17$RAgecat5.f<-as_factor(bsa17$RAgecat5)
bsa17$Rsex.f<-as_factor(bsa17$Rsex)

bsa17.s<-svydesign(ids=~Spoint+Sserial, strata=~StratID, weights=~WtFactor,data=bsa17)

round(100*svyby(~I(Politics.s=="Significantly"),by=~RAgecat5.f+Rsex.f,svyciprop,design=bsa17.s,vartype = "ci")[c(-8,-4),c(-2,-1)],1)
``` 
Older respondents both male and female tend to be more involved in politics than younger ones.

The confidence interval for the proportion of men under 35 and women above 55 interested in politics overlaps; it is unlikely that they  differ in the population.




# 6. SPSS Examples
At the time of writing this document (September 2023) Standard editions of SPSS  did not include support for estimation with survey design variables, and only limited use of sampling weights. When using grossing weights -- ie weight that have been designed to enable computing population totals from sample data -- as is the case for instance with the Labour Force and Family Resources surveys, measures of dispersion and standard errors will not be adequately computed. It is therefore not recommended to attempt using the base version of SPSS with survey data beyond estimating point estimates. Significance testing, and standard errors will not reflect the correct values. Users wanting to use SPSS with survey data will need to acquire the Premium Edition or the Complex Samples add-on of the software.

In this exercise, we will  practice statistical inference with data from the  [2017 British Social Attitudes Survey (BSA)](https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/studies/study?id=8450) taking into account weights and  survey design variables. Please note that at the time of writing this document only some of the BSA editions  include survey design variables.


## 6.1 Identifying the survey design and variables

We first need to find out about the survey design that was used in the 2017 BSA, and the design variables that are made available in the dataset. Such information can usually be found in the documentation that comes together with the data under the ```mrdoc/pdf``` folder. 

**Question 1**
What is the design that was used in this survey (ie how many stages were there, and what were the units sampled). What were the primary sampling units; the strata (if relevant)?

Now that we are a bit more familiar with the way the survey was designed, we need to try and identify the design variables we can include when producing estimates. The information can usually be found in the user manual or the data dictionary available under ```mrdoc/ukda_data_dictionaries.zip``` You may need to decompress the file separately

**Question 2**
What survey design variables are available? Are there any ones that are missing -- if so which ones? What is the name of the weights variables?

## 6.2 Specifying the survey design 

Let us first open the 2017 BSA dataset.
```
CD 'C:\Users\mscsepw2\OneDrive - The University of Manchester\Surveyskills'.
  GET 
    FILE=' BSA\UKDA-8450-spss\spss\spss25\bsa2017_for_ukda.sav'.
```

In principle, we should  tell SPSS that we are working with a three stage stratified cluster sample. In practice however, we only have information about the initial ie primary sampling units.  
This is achieved with the ```CSPLAN``` command through we create a plan file which contains the survey design information.


```
CSPLAN ANALYSIS
  /PLAN FILE='bsa17_SPSS_design.csaplan'
  /PLANVARS ANALYSISWEIGHT=WtFactor       
  /SRSESTIMATOR TYPE=WOR
  /PRINT PLAN
  /DESIGN STAGELABEL='S1' STRATA=StratID CLUSTER=Spoint 
  /ESTIMATOR TYPE=WR.
```

## 6.3 Mean age and its 95% confidence interval
We can now produce a first set of estimates using this design and compare them with those we would have got without accounting for  it. We will compute the average (ie mean) age of respondents in the sample, as well as the proportion of male and female respondents aged over 55. We will need to use ```/CSDESCRIPTIVES```
```
DATASET ACTIVATE DataSet1.
* Complex Samples Descriptives.
CSDESCRIPTIVES
  /PLAN FILE='bsa17_SPSS_design.csaplan'
  /SUMMARY VARIABLES=RAgeE
  /MEAN
  /STATISTICS SE CIN(95)
  /MISSING SCOPE=ANALYSIS CLASSMISSING=EXCLUDE.

```
 Under the ```/STATISTICS``` command  we can request either or both the standard error of the mean and its 95% confidence interval. 

What difference would it make to the estimates and 95% CI to compute respectively, an unweighted mean, as well as a weighted mean without accounting for the survey design? 


**Unweighted means and CI**

```
DESCRIPTIVES VARIABLES=RAgeE
  /STATISTICS=MEAN SEMEAN.
```

SPSS does not provide an option for computing confidence intervals in this case, but we know that  a 95% confidence interval is the sample mean respectively minus and plus 1.96 times its standard error.  Using the SPSS output, we can compute it ourselves as 1.96*.2872=about .56 years, that is close to 7 months. 

**Weighted means and CI without survey design**

```
WEIGHT BY WtFactor.
DESCRIPTIVES VARIABLES=RAgeE
  /STATISTICS=MEAN SEMEAN.
WEIGHT OFF.
```


**Question 3**
What would be the consequences of weighting but not accounting for the sample design; not using  weights and accounting for the sample design when:

- inferring the mean value of the population age?
- inferring the uncertainty  of our estimate of the population age? 

## 6.4 Computing a proportion and its 95% confidence interval
We can now similarly compute an estimate of a proportion (or percentage)  of a categorical variable in the population. For instance, the proportion of people who declare themselves interested in politics. This is the ```Politics``` variable. It has five categories that we are going to recode into 'Significantly' (interested) and 'Not' (significantly) in order to simplify the analysis. 


```
FREQUENCIES VARIABLES=Politics
  /ORDER=ANALYSIS.

RECODE Politics (9=SYSMIS) (1 thru 2=1) (3 thru 5=2) INTO Politics.s.
EXECUTE.

VARIABLE LABELS
Politics.s   "Whether significantly interested in politics".
VALUE LABELS
Politics.s
1  "Significant"
2  "Not significant". 
EXECUTE.

FREQUENCIES VARIABLES=Politics.s
  /ORDER=ANALYSIS.

WEIGHT BY WtFactor.
FREQUENCIES VARIABLES=Politics.s
  /ORDER=ANALYSIS.
WEIGHT OFF.
```
As with the mean of age earlier, we can see that the weighted and unweighted point estimates of the proportion of respondents  significantly interested in politics change, even if  slightly, and that they remain the same when survey design is accounted for. 

With the help of `CSTABULATE` we can  examine frequencies, proportions and confidence intervals of these proportions accounting for the survey design. As before, the point estimates do not further change once survey design is accounted for.


```
* Complex Samples Frequencies.
CSTABULATE
  /PLAN FILE='bsa17_SPSS_design.csaplan'
  /TABLES VARIABLES=Politics.s
  /CELLS POPSIZE TABLEPCT
  /STATISTICS CIN(95) 
  /MISSING SCOPE=TABLE CLASSMISSING=EXCLUDE.
```                     

**Question 4**
What is the proportion of respondents aged 17-34 in the sample, as well as its 95% confidence interval? You can use ```RAgecat5```

## 6.5 Domain (ie subpopulation) estimates
Although computing estimates for specific groups (for example the average age of people who report being interested in politics) is not conceptually different from doing it for the sample as a whole, doing it with weights as part of an inferential analysis requires some caution. Calculating weighted estimates  for  a subpopulation while the rest of the sample is left out of the analysis might  yield incorrect results. This is why using survey design informed functions  is particularly recommended when doing such analyses.

The SPSS command `CSDESCRIPTIVES` that we used above makes such domain estimation relatively straightforward. If we would like to compute the mean age of BSA respondents by government office regions, we need to specify:

- The outcome variable whose estimate we want to compute: ie ```RAgeE```
- The grouping variable(s) ```GOR_ID```
- And the type of type of variance estimation we would like to see displayed ie standard errors or confidence interval  


```{r bygor2,echo=F, include=F}
bsa17$gor.f<-as_factor(bsa17$GOR_ID)
bsa17.s<-svydesign(ids=~Spoint+Sserial, strata=~StratID, weights=~WtFactor,data=bsa17)

round(svyby(~RAgeE,by=~gor.f,svymean,design=bsa17.s,vartype = "ci")[-1])
```

```
 * Complex Samples Descriptives.
CSDESCRIPTIVES
  /PLAN FILE='bsa17_SPSS_design.csaplan'
  /SUMMARY VARIABLES=RAgeE
  /SUBPOP TABLE=GOR_ID DISPLAY=LAYERED
  /MEAN
  /STATISTICS CIN(95)
  /MISSING SCOPE=ANALYSIS CLASSMISSING=EXCLUDE.

```
 Our inference seem to suggest that the population in London is among the youngest in the country, and that those in the South West are among the oldest -- their respective 95% confidence intervals do not overlap. We should not feel  so confident about differences between London and the South East for example, as the CIs partially overlap.  

We can also examine proportions for subpopulations. In order to do this, we need to specify the category of the variable we are interested in as an outcome. For instance, the syntax below uses respondents who are significantly interested in politics:
 
```
* Complex Samples Frequencies.
CSTABULATE
  /PLAN FILE='bsa17_SPSS_design.csaplan'
  /TABLES VARIABLES=Politics.s
  /SUBPOP TABLE=GOR_ID DISPLAY=LAYERED
  /CELLS TABLEPCT
  /STATISTICS CIN(95) 
  /MISSING SCOPE=TABLE CLASSMISSING=EXCLUDE.
```


```{r bygorprop2,echo=F}
#round(100*svyby(~I(Politics.s=="Significantly"),by=~gor.f,svyciprop,design=bsa17.s,vartype = "ci")[-1],1)

#round(100*svyby(~I(Politics.s=="Significantly"),by=~gor.f,svyciprop,design=bsa17.s,vartype = "ci")[-1],1)[9,c(2,3)]
```

**Question 5**
What is the 95% confidence interval for the proportion of people interested in politics in the South West? Is the proportion likely to be different in London? In what way? What is the region of the UK for which the precision of the estimates is likely to be the smallest?

When using `CSTABULATE`, we can  define domains or subpopulations with several variables, not just one. For example, we could look at gender differences in political affiliations by regions. However, as the size of subgroups decrease, so does the precision of the estimates as their confidence interval widens, to a point where their substantive interest is not meaningful anymore. 

 **Question 6**
Using interest in politics as before, and three category age 
`RAgecat5`: 

- Produce a table of results showing the proportion of respondents significantly interested in Politics by age group and gender


- Assess whether the age difference in interest for politics is similar for each gender?

- Based on the data, is it fair to say that men aged under 35 tend to  be more likely to declare  themselves  interested  in politics  than women aged 55 and above?

``` 
Older respondents both male and female tend to be more involved in politics than younger ones.

The confidence interval for the proportion of men under 35 and women above 55 interested in politics overlaps; it is unlikely that they  differ in the population.

# 7 Stata examples
Stata provides comprehensive support for computing estimates from survey data. Users may either opt to add sampling weights to the standard estimation commands, or use survey-specific commands. The latter is recommended when  knowledge of estimate precision is required. Stata provides a conceptual distinction between four types of weights: 

- frequency weights (`fweight`), 
- analytical weights (`aweight`), 
- importance weights (`iweight`) and 
- probability weights (`pweight`). 

 These differences impact on the way standard errors are computed during estimation. In most cases, social survey weights from UKDS datasets should be treated as probability weights. A number of of basic estimation commands, such as *summarise* do not allow using probability weights. This is an explicit features of Stata, meant to nudge users of survey data to prioritise the survey commands rather than 'casual' weighting.

Using standalone weight specification  (ie not using survey design functions). In Stata it consists in the weighting variable being specified between square brackets. Stata defines four kind of weights:

Only probability weights (abbreviated as `pw` in most Stata commands) should be used with survey data. However, Stata does not allow using them with its main commands, for the reason highlighted above ie in order for users not overlook survey design issues in their data. Therefore, one has to specify instead the wrong frequency weights (`fw`) if one does not wish to use the survey design functions.




# 8. Appendix: Study-specific weighting and sample design information

## 8.1 British Social Attitudes Survey
The  BSA is a three stage stratified random survey, with postcode sectors, addresses and individuals as the units selected at each stage. Primary sampling units were furthermore stratified according to geographies (sub regions), population density, and proportion of owner-occupiers. Sampling rate was proportional to the size of postcode sectors (ie number of addresses).
Some issues of the BSA such as the 2017 include survey design information.
The 2017 issue included information about Primary Smapling Units (`Spoint`), strata (`StratID`). Weights are called `WtFactor`.


## 8.2 Labour Force Survey 
The LFS is a geographically stratified random survey. For the main part  Primary sampling units are addresses within postcode sectors, drawn from the  Small Users Postcode Address File (PAF). The small users PAF is limited to addresses which receive, fewer than 50 items of post per day. In a small number of cases a second stage sampling occurs where several households exist at a given address. A clustering effect is also present to the extent that units of observations are individuals within households, and that some groups are clustered within these, typically ethnicity.
LFS weights:
- PWTxx – person level sampling weight; enables inferring population counts
- IWTxx - Person-level  sampling weight for income analysis (ie subsample of people in paid work)
- PHHWTxx - Household-level  sampling weight (for household-level analysis)

## 8.3 Family Resources Survey 
The FRS is a stratified clustered random survey, with survey design differing slightly between countries of the UK. In Great Britain, Primary sampling units are  postcode sectors, drawn from the  Small Users Postcode Address File (PAF). Before being selected, PSUs are stratified according to geography, proportion of household reference persons from higher social classes in the area, proportion of economically active respondents in the area, and proportion of economically active men who are unemployed.
