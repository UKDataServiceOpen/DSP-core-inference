# Design-Based Inference from Social Surveys

Conducting *inference* from surveys involves estimating population
parameters (like means or medians) sometimes also called *point
estimates* and measuring their precision (e.g. confidence intervals or
                                          standard errors). Both the estimates and their precision can be affected
by the sampling design.

-   **Stratification** improves precision by increasing sample size in
key subgroups.
-   **Clustering** typically reduces precision by lowering sample
diversity.
-   **Survey weights**—used to correct for unequal selection or
non-response—can also affect precision, often negatively.

Because most surveys combine these methods, the impact on precision
depends on what is being estimated and for which subgroup.

There are two main ways to produce design-adjusted population estimates:
  
1.  **Design-based estimation**: directly accounts for sampling design.
2.  **Model-based estimation**: models the effects of the survey design.

This guide focuses on the **design-based approach**, which is more
straightforward for estimating means, medians, and totals.

## Survey Design Variables
  
  **Survey weights** are special variables in survey datasets. Roughly
speaking, they indicate how many people or units each observation
represents in the population. Weights are usually:
  
  -   **Higher** for people less likely to be sampled (e.g. young men in
                                                       cities)
-   **Lower** for people more likely to be sampled (e.g. older women)

Survey weights are usually made up of three components:
  
  -   **Design weight**: adjusts for unequal selection probabilities.
-   **Non-response weight**: corrects for groups with lower response
rates.
-   **Calibration weight**: aligns the sample with population estimates
(e.g. by age, sex, or region from census data).

These components are often combined into a single weight variable. When
weights are scaled to population totals, they are sometimes called
**grossing weights**.

  **How are weights computed?**
  
  Survey designers use *calibration algorithms* to adjust the distribution
of observations so they match known population totals across variables
like age, gender, and employment. The goal is to:
  
  -   Keep standard errors low by avoiding small sample sizes in cells
-   Improve representativeness across key categories

------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  **Survey design variables** usually include:
  
  -   **Strata identifiers**
  -   **Cluster identifiers**, especially the *Primary Sampling Units*
  (PSUs)

When used alongside survey weights, design variables allow analysts to
produce more accurate estimates using survey-specific functions in
statistical software. When they are not included, most statistical
software will compute standard errors/confidence intervals based on the
incorrect assumption of simple random sampling.

> Note: While most UK Data Service datasets include survey weights, not
> all provide design variables due to data protection concerns.

## Design Effects and Design Factors
  
  When survey design variables are missing, users can still account for
complex sampling using:
  
  -   **Design effects** (DEFF or $D_{eff}$)
-   **Design factors** ($D_{eft}$)

These measure how much the **standard error** of an estimate differs
from what it would be under simple random sampling (SRS) [@Kish1995],
and are sometimes published by data producers.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  ### Definitions
  
  -   The **Design effect (**$D_{eff}$) is the ratio of the actual
variance of an estimate to the variance under SRS:
  
  $D_{eff} =\frac{Var_{design}(\hat{\theta})}{Var_{SRS}(\hat{\theta})}$
  
  -   The **Design factor (**$D_eft$) is the square root of the
design effect:
  
  $D_{eft} = \sqrt{D_{eff}}$
  
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  ### Interpretation
  
  -   If $D_{eff} < 1$: the sample design improves precision.
-   If $D_{eff} > 1$: the sample design reduces precision.

Data providers sometimes include estimates of $D_{eff}$ or
$D_{eft}$ so users can *adjust standard errors or confidence
intervals* that were incorrectly computed under SRS assumptions.
