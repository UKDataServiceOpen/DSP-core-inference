# Appendix: Study-specific weighting and sample design information

## British Social Attitudes Survey

The BSA is a three stage stratified random survey, with postcode
sectors, addresses and individuals as the units selected at each stage.
Primary sampling units were furthermore stratified according to
geographies (sub regions), population density, and proportion of
owner-occupiers. Sampling rate was proportional to the size of postcode
sectors (i.e. number of addresses). Some issues of the BSA such as the
2017 include survey design information. The 2017 issue included
information about Primary Smapling Units (`Spoint`), strata (`StratID`).
Weights are called `WtFactor`.

## Labour Force Survey

The LFS is a geographically stratified random survey. For the main part
Primary sampling units are addresses within postcode sectors, drawn from
the Small Users Postcode Address File (PAF). The small users PAF is
limited to addresses which receive, fewer than 50 items of post per day.
In a small number of cases a second stage sampling occurs where several
households exist at a given address. A clustering effect is also present
to the extent that units of observations are individuals within
households, and that some groups are clustered within these, typically
ethnicity. LFS weights (all of these include a grossing component that
                        enables estimation of population counts): - PWTxx â€“ person level
sampling weight; - PIWTxx - person-level sampling weight for income
analysis (i.e. subsample of people in paid work) - PHHWTxx -
  Household-level sampling weight (for household-level analysis)

## Family Resources Survey

The FRS is a stratified clustered random survey, with survey design
differing slightly between countries of the UK. In Great Britain,
Primary sampling units are postcode sectors, drawn from the Small Users
Postcode Address File (PAF). Before being selected, PSUs are stratified
according to geography, proportion of household reference persons from
higher social classes in the area, proportion of economically active
respondents in the area, and proportion of economically active men who
are unemployed. In Northern Ireland, the sample is a systematic random
sample of addresses.
